# Implement Theme System

## Why
Users requested the ability to switch between three distinct visual styles (Modern, Retro Arcade, Classic Paper) to customize their platform experience. This enhances immersion and appeals to different player demographics.

## Goal
Implement a global theme system that supports switching between Modern, Retro, and Classic styles, updating the Home page, Hero section, and Game Cards accordingly.

## Scope
- Theme Context & Switcher
- CSS/Tailwind configuration for themes
- 3 Variants of Home Hero
- Styled Game Cards for each theme
