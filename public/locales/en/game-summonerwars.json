      "attackExplain": "Attack phase! Attack with up to 3 units.\n\nStrength = number of dice. Only matching attack type faces deal damage.\n\n⚠️ If you don't attack, your Summoner takes 1 penalty damage!",
      "meleeExplain": "⚔️ Melee units can only attack adjacent targets (up/down/left/right).\n\nMelee dice face ⚔️ = 1 damage.",

      "endAttack": "You can attack with more units, or click \"End Phase\".",
      "magicExplain": "Magic phase: Discard cards to gain magic.\n\n1 discarded card = 1 Magic. Convert unneeded cards into resources!",
